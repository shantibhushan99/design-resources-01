## Design Resources Finder For Developer

This is a design resource finder developed with React.js
Inspired by [Brad Traversy's repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers)

## Add Resources

Add resources in the folder resources, make sure to add them after the last element, because the IDs are generated via the index.
It can lead to issues with the favorites who are stored in local storage if the id does not match.

## Tools

the folder tools was used to convert from the original repo's read me file to a JavaScript object. I can be deleted if needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
